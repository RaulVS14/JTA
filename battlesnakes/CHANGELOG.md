-- TASK 1 - Fix getRandomMove test and method
* Updated com.battle.snakes.util.SnakeUtilTest > getRandomMove() with proper assertion
Finished logic of getRandomMove method located in SnakeUtil class

* TODO - Write this test and finish the getRandomMove method located in the SnakeUtil class. Remember, a passing test does not equal to a good test.

-- TASK 2 - Finish getAllowedMoves
* Finish getNextMoveCoords method in order to simplify calculating coordinates for getAllowedMoves method

* Finish isInBounds method for checking if coordinates fit onto the board in order to validate getAllowedMoves coordinates

* Create logic for the getAllowedMoves method and finish it

-- TASK 3 - Finish rest of methods
* Finish getDistance method

* Finish getNearestMoveToTarget method using the getDistance method and getNextMoveCoords method

* Finish getNearestCoordinateToTarget using getDistance method

-- TASK 4 - Genius snake + 3 meaningful tests

* TODO! Run the snake controlled with the GeniusSnakeController through the game engine . Make this
        snake as good as you can at playing the game. It should be better than the “smart” snake. 
        Bonus points will be awarded for writing at least 3 tests for your “genius” snake, 
        if they are meaningful.
        Be warned though, copying other people’s solutions will get you no points. Reading about what
        other people have done and incorporating ideas is encouraged. Remember, the goal here is to
        create a slightly improved “smart” snake, not solve the many-body problem.
