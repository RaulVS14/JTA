This is an example changelog, the purpose of it is to help us figure out faster what you worked
on and what you skipped.You will not be graded on how great this changelog is (or is not),
so make it simple. Delete the contents and write your own notes here.


-- TASK 1
Updated com.battle.snakes.util.SnakeUtilTest > getRandomMove() with proper assertion
Finished logic of getRandomMove method located in SnakeUtil class

-- TASK 2
* TODO! Run the RandomSnakeController ’s snake through the game engine. It does not look very
        random. Finish the getAllowedMoves method in the SnakeUtil class to fix this Snake. Make sure
        it does not collide with other snakes or itself (unless it is trapped).

-- TASK 3
* TODO! Run the snake controlled with the SmartSnakeController through the game engine. Finish the
        rest of the methods in the SnakeUtil class to make the “smart” snake smart. It is a lot better than
        the “random” snake. But not really that good for planning more than a step.

-- TASK 4
* TODO! Run the snake controlled with the GeniusSnakeController through the game engine . Make this
        snake as good as you can at playing the game. It should be better than the “smart” snake. Bonus
        points will be awarded for writing at least 3 tests for your “genius” snake, if they are meaningful.
        Be warned though, copying other people’s solutions will get you no points. Reading about what
        other people have done and incorporating ideas is encouraged. Remember, the goal here is to
        create a slightly improved “smart” snake, not solve the many-body problem.
